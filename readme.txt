Participation in an open source project
---------------------------------------
Contributing to an open source project gives students a chance to experience collaboration and reuse much in the same way it happens in an open source project.
The reason for choosing a website as a software project is that it is typically a type of software familiar to anyone. It is also not a complicated type of software requiring technical skills. 
There will be conflicts between what people contribute, and this is part of the experience of open source projects. This might lead to appreciation of the amount of effort made to coordinate the linux kernel development.

Seminar style
-------------
Some classes can be a seminar style, but not all and definitely not the first fews ones where a background information is lacking by many students. I suggest excluding the first three classes from the seminar style "An Introduction", "Hackers", "Intellectual Property: Theory and History"

Memos
-----
While I wouldn't use memos as an educational tool if I were to teach this course, I still realize their usefulness. They can be used a guarantee that the material has been read and understood.
However, to allow better quality of memos the frequency of memos should be less. I suggest starting submitting the memos at the fourth class with the seminar style class.
Alternatively, Memo's could be due Mondays but not Wednesdays because of the limited time between Monday and Wednesday classes.
Finally, I don't see a value in having a chair summarizing the contents of the memos, and there it should be cancelled along with the 8 am deadline.
